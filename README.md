# Blue-Sky-Online-Retailer-Data-Warehouse-Implementation
Designed and deployed a robust data warehouse solution for a UK-based online retailer, Blue Sky, with a focus on seamless big data integration. A simple star schema was initially created to organize data efficiently. Data was first loaded into a staging environment for validation and transformations, ensuring accuracy before being transferred into actual tables. After the data was organized and processed in SQL, the tables were exported and loaded into HDFS to enable scalable storage and big data analysis.

# Key Components:
• Implement a data warehouse for centralized storage and improved data accessibility.  
• Design a star schema to facilitate streamlined data queries and analysis.  
• Utilize a staging environment to ensure data accuracy before loading into final tables.  
• Export processed data from SQL tables to HDFS for scalable storage and enhanced data processing.  
• Use Apache Pig for data transformations to prepare data for reporting and analytics.  

# Technologies Used
**Language**: SQL  
**Tools**: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Apache Hadoop, Apache Pig, ETL tools, HDFS  

# Benefits:
This project empowered Blue Sky to effectively manage and validate large datasets, streamline ETL processes, and ensure high-quality data in the data warehouse. The integration of HDFS enabled scalable storage, supporting more robust analytics and insights into customer and operational trends.
